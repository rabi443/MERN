# How to unlink?
-> git remote -v
    result: like this
        origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (push)

-> git remote remove origin
    note:This deletes the link to GitHub.
        Your local repo will remain intact, but it won’t push/pull anymore.

->git remote -v
    note : You should see no output, meaning it’s unlinked.

-> Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

    note :-Recurse → deletes all files and subfolders inside .git

        -Force → deletes hidden/system files

        .git → the Git folder to remove

        Your local folder will no longer be a Git repository.

        All files remain intact.

        You can optionally reinitialize Git later again
